Changes from V1.71 to V1.72 as from 13/1/93

Changed prompt updates. TUsh now only redraws the prompt when nothing
is pending on the socket input, instead of at every line end. This
means faster scrolling to equal that of straight telnet or other
frontends. 

New command 'set wildcard' allowing change of alias and trigger
wildcard.

New command 'malloc' mainly for my own debugging and amusement B-)

Added %b and %x escapes.


Changes from v1.72 to v1.73 as from 27/1/93

Added command 'set alias' to turn off alias processor
Added command 'set trigger' to turn off trigger processor
Added command 'auto kill' to kill shells on connection close

Added 'set ga' command, and Go Ahead signal support. TUsh now
recognises if a prompt has been sent, and sets its own prompt
accordingly.

Increased resistance to bad termcaps.

Added 'titlebar' command for Xterm users.

Changes from v1.73 to 1.74 as from 20/2/93

Provided support for IAC EOR as well as IAC GA (they both do the same
thing ...) IAC EOR will always overide IAC GA if its available.

Changed the 'set ga' command to the more general 'set prompt mode'
command, and increased the help on the whole prompt business.

Changed IAC handling again, so that it works properly. 

Better portability

No longer echos password when doing local echoing.
