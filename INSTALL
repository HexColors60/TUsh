	Installing TUsh could not be easier. 

1) Edit the file 'Makefile'

	Change DEST to the directory you want TUsh to be installed in.
	It's wise to make this the full pathname of the destination
	directory, but simply putting . will suffice.

	If your system doesn't have gcc (most do) change the CC = gcc
	to read CC = cc.

	If want any fancy compiler flags change the CFLAGS variable,
	otherwise leave it as it is.

2) Edit the file 'config.h'

	You shouldn't really need to change anything in here. Though
	you can change it to suit your own tastes if you desire.

3) type 'make install'

	If all goes well, you will be left with an executable in the
	DEST directory, named the same as PROGRAM.

	If you have problems with the 'check_malloc' function, or your
	compiler can't find 'mallopt'. Then re-edit the Makefile, to
	include the bit indicated.

	If you are using gcc with SunOS and get ioctl errors when
	running the program. Edit the Makefile so as to use cc.

4) read the doc on how to use it (tush.doc), take a look at the sample
   files in the directory 'Samples' and away you go.
