TUsh is a front end for telnet protocol connections. Features on offer
are (among many more) powerful macro processing, virtual screen
display, site list and multiple connections.

The original TUsh source was programmed entirely by Simon Marsh. The
program comes as is, without any liability or guarantees. Though I
retain copyright of the source code, you may freely distribute it
throughout the entire known universe. 
If you make any alterations to the source, and subsequently distribute
the result, leave clear headers explaining who has altered what, and
when. 

To install TUsh, read the documention in the INSTALL file.

Instructions on how to use TUsh are contained within the tush.doc
file.

Feel free to mail any suggestions/bugs to me, though I make no
guarantees about future coding.



Have fun ..


Simon Marsh
